/**
 * Velocity finds speed of an object by its distance over time.
 * Say an alien moves 30 meters forward in 3 seconds. We can calculate the velocity of the alien using the formula below.
 * (V)ELOCITY = (D)ISTANCE / (T)IME
 * 
 * e.g. (30 / 3) = 10 == 10 = (30 / 3)
 **/

 /**
 * Gravity is a downwards force that pulls objects towards the ground and imparts an accelaration.
 * Velocity is change in position where as accelaration is change in velocity.
 * 
 * In free fall, all objects in real life accelarate at 9.8 m/s per second when falling towards the earth.
 * Meaning each second, the change in downwards velocity towards planet earth increases 9.8 meters every second.
 * 
 * (A)CCELARATION = (ãŽ§)/s
 * (F)ORCE = (M)ASS * (A)CCELARATION
